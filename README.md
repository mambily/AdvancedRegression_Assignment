# Advanced Regression - House Price Prediction


> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market.

> Build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

> The company wants to know:
* Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
* How well those variables describe the price of a house.

> Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

> Business Goal
Model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

- Result Interpretation
- Model Evaluation 


## Conclusions
- Ridge and Lasso Regression gives better performace on test and train data and is more robust compared to Linear Regression Model
- Non linear variables can be modelled by applying transformations
- The top 2 features for both Lasso and Ridge models are : Overall Quality score of the house and the Living area above ground in Square Feet.
- Lasso is more robust compared to Ridge considering the number of predictors selected.
